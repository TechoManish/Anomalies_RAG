I want to invest long term in mutual funds with moderate risk.
I am saving for retirement and prefer low volatility investments.
I want to diversify my portfolio safely.
I plan to invest monthly through SIPs.
I am comfortable with balanced equity and debt funds.
I want stable returns rather than aggressive growth.
